# Decentralized-Data-Architecture-Use-Case
Use Case: Customer Experience &amp; Order Fallout Reduction Problem Statement: A leading telecom operator struggles with siloed data across BSS (Business Support Systems) and OSS (Operational Support Systems), leading to:  High order fallouts due to inconsistent data.  Delays in service fulfillment due to fragmented network data.  


Decentralized Data Architecture Using Databricks
1. Data Domains & Decentralization Strategy
Customer Data Domain: Unified customer profiles, billing, interaction logs.

Order Data Domain: Order lifecycle, provisioning, and fulfillment status.

Network Data Domain: Network inventory, resource allocation, and faults.

Usage Data Domain: Real-time service usage, QoS monitoring, and anomalies.

Each domain is owned by respective teams but made accessible via Databricks Unity Catalog with governance and lineage tracking.

2. Data Ingestion & Processing
Streaming Data: Kafka & Delta Live Tables (DLT) for real-time order tracking.

Batch Data: Legacy OSS/BSS extracts via Auto Loader.

Unstructured Data: PDFs & logs (e.g., network faults) processed using Databricks AI.

3. Real-Time Order Fallout Prediction
Feature Store:

Order history, network conditions, customer churn risk.

ML Models on Databricks:

Train a model to classify potential fallouts based on order attributes, network status, and past failures.

Real-time Prediction:

Deploy via MLflow, feeding results into Salesforce Service Cloud for proactive resolution.

4. Data Sharing & Governance with Delta Sharing
Expose key datasets to partner systems (e.g., logistics, field engineers).

Monitor access via Unity Catalog to prevent data leakage.

5. Business Impact
✅ 30% reduction in order fallouts with predictive analytics.
✅ Faster service fulfillment through real-time network insights.
✅ Improved regulatory compliance with controlled data access.
